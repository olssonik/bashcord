# bashcord
Please download this script in your home directory for now
To start:

git clone https://github.com/olssonik/bashcord.git

cd bashcord

chmod +x bashcord.sh

./bashcord.sh

(chmod gives bashcord.sh permission)

script is not complicated, i am not trying to actually make any kind of discord clone, i just want to learn bash a bit better and have fun
